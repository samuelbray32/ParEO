**Par**ameter **E**stimates from **O**bservables (**ParEO**)
========

Often in biology and other fields, you may want to fit a set of time-series data to an ODE model of the processes generating it. This problem becomes non-trivial and often intractable if:
* The underlying dynamics are non-linear
* The system does not always begin from the initial state and/or the complete set of generative states cannot be observed in the data

For example, the behavior and sensory processing of an organism is generated by a large number of interacting neural states that cannot always be measured.

**ParEO** offers a standardized method for model parameter fitting in these scenarios. By inferring a reconstructed state-space of the latent attractor from observable measurements it can converge to accurate parameter values for near-arbitrary deterministic systems including non-linear and chaotic. Moreover, the method requires minimal technical expertise to adapt to a new model, All that is required is for time-step updates to be written in tensorflow-compatible format. For a complete theoretical description of the method see the included PDF (in-progress, will be published in an archival site on completion).
